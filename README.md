This is a small personal project aimed at practicing my HTML and CSS skills. It incorporates various features I have recently learned, including basic CSS styling and Flexbox for layout management. The goal of the project was to create a tourism ad for my hometown, San Antonio.<br> <br>
I completed this project as part of Scrimba's HTML & CSS course, and was tasked with creating a website that followed [this Figma design.](https://www.figma.com/design/vODAxwV1F1XJjKXRdcrvF7/Hometown-Homepage-(Copy)?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=gWoBMcwfSIz4kyEy-0) I built the code from scratch, which helped solidify many of the concepts and syntax I've learned.<br> <br>
One key feature of the site is the background image of the San Antonio River Walk. I implemented this to enhance the viewing experience, as otherwise, the page would have had a blank background due to the 720px width of the ad.
